# Better storage.<br/>Better transfers.<br/>Better internet.

> When you need file storage for your project, website, or application, web3.storage is here for you. All it takes to [get started](./getting-started/) storing on the decentralized web is a free account — no need to wrestle with complicated details.

With web3.storage, you get all the benefits of decentralized storage technologies with the frictionless experience you expect in a modern dev workflow. **All you need to use web3.storage is an account and your data.** Under the hood, web3.storage is backed by the provable storage of [Filecoin](https://filecoin.io) and makes data accessible to your users over the public [IPFS](https://ipfs.io) network — but when it comes down to building your next application, service, or website, all you need to know is that web3.storage makes building on decentralized technologies simple.

This site contains documentation for w3up, our next-generation storage API based on [User controlled authorization networks (UCAN)](./concepts/ucan/index.md). If you're looking for the docs for the current production API, head to [our main documentation site](https://web3.storage/docs).
