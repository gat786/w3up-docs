Coming soon: a detailed look at the mechanics of UCAN delegation that explains:

- [ ] the roles of each principal (issuer and audience)
- [ ] how to understand what is being delegated (resources and capabilities)
  - [ ] include real-world example, e.g. delegating store/add
- [ ] how to limit delegations by expiration time or with caveats (e.g. size limits on upload)
