title: API Reference

Welcome to the API reference documentation for our JavaScript client packages.

The most important package is [`w3up-client`](./w3up-client/), our main JavaScript client library. `w3up-client` provides everything you need to use the w3up platform, including file uploads, account and identity management and more.

If you want to dive a bit deeper into the protocol, we've included the reference docs for our [UCAN protocol client packages](./w3protocol/). These are defined in the [w3protocol GitHub repository](https://github.com/web3-storage/w3protocol), which also includes service implementations. Since the UCAN client packages are used internally by `w3up-client`, it can be helpful to have access to the documentation when exploring advanced client functionality.

For more details about the protocol design, please see our [specs repository](https://github.com/web3-storage/specs), which includes specifications for our current protocol and discussions about future directions.
